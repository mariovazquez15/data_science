# data_science
## Proyecto para data_science
### La carpeta *data_science* contiene la aplicaci√≥n desarrollada en Django:
* **admin.py**: This is where you register models to include them into the Django administration site. Using the Django admin site is optional.

* **migrations**: This directory will contain database migrations of your application. Migrations allow Django to track your model changes and synchronize the database accordingly.

* **models.py**: Data models of your application. All Django applications need to have a models.py file, but this file can be left empty.

* **tests.py**: This is where you can add tests for your application.

* **views.py**: The logic of your application goes here. Each view receives an HTTP request, processes it, and returns a response.
